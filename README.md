# E-Learning

## Purpose
This repository hosts my submissions for the assignments in the MOOCs I have taken. It is also to have a look at my solutions after some time and try improving them.

## Courses
  - **[Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/shubhanshu02/e-learning/tree/master/Algorithmic%20Toolbox)** - The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.
  - **[Data Structures](https://github.com/shubhanshu02/e-learning/tree/master/Data%20Structures)** - In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems.

> A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently.

  - **[Bootstrap 4](https://github.com/shubhanshu02/e-learning/tree/master/Bootstrap)** (In Progress) - In this course, we learn about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. We learn about CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass. We also learn the basics of Node.js and NPM and task runners like Grunt and Gulp.
  - **[Algorithms on Graphs](https://github.com/shubhanshu02/e-learning/tree/master/Algorithms%20on%20Graphs)** (In Progress) - Graphs arise in various real-world situations as there are road networks, computer networks and, most recently, social networks! In this course, we learn about various algorithms on graphs.
